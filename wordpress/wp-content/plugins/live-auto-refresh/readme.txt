== Description ==

**THIS PLUGIN IS FOR USE DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF WORDPRESS THEMES**

Live Auto Refresh helps developers instantly see changes made to theme code or content by automatically reloading the browser. No manual refresh is needed.

This greatly enhances the productivity and accuracy of web development. It allows the developer to test and debug the website in real time and to instantly view how the content appears on the front end of all loaded logged in browsers and devices. With this feature, the developer can always ensure that the website matches the intended design and functionality.

This plugin is only active for logged-in administrators and does not affect regular site visitors.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What files does this monitor for code changes? =

By default, only .php, .js, and .css files within the active theme and child theme are monitored for changes. This improves performance and avoids unnecessary checks on other files.

= Do style changes reload the page? =

Changes to CSS files will hot reload to display the updates styling without reloading the HTML DOM.

= What content saves trigger a refresh? =

Editor saves to the wordpress page or post content.

= How are PHP errors handled? =

If WP_DEBUG is enabled then any non critical error messages will display.
Critical errors will prevent the plugin running, so a manual reload will be required once the code error is fixed to restart monitoring.
