== WHY DO YOU NEED A SALES FUNNEL? ==

A sales funnel takes the users from downloading a lead magnet to buying your product or service. Not only that, it boosts your average order value through order bumps and one-click upsells.

Here are some major benefits of a sales funnel:

- **Lesser Distractions:** Users go from one step to the next without any exit points along the way.
- **Higher Returns on Ad Spends:** Creating optimized user journeys allows you to maximize returns on ad spends.
- **Greater Order Value:** Showing customers relevant pre and post-purchase offers, they can accept with one click, hence increasing the order value.
- **Higher Conversion Rates:** With marketing automation added to your sales funnel, you can bring abandoned users back to complete their purchase.

Let's explore the essential features of FunnelKit.


=== FUNNEL BUILDER LITE FEATURES ===

= TRULY FLEXIBLE WOOCOMMERCE CHECKOUT FIELD EDITOR =

While most checkout field editors let you simply rearrange fields in rigid sections, our field editor is built to give you extreme flexibility. It's the most advanced WooCommerce checkout solution, engineered from the ground up that lets you:

- Create your own sections
- Drag and drop fields within sections
- Re-order and remove fields you don't need

You can of course create a store checkout in WooCommerce or add products to make it product-specific.


**Customizable WooCommerce Thank You Pages**

The default thank you page looks bland and isn't optimized to carry the conversation forward. With our highly customizable templates and widgets, you can create beautiful order confirmation pages.


**Templates for Every Step**

With FunnelKit Funnel Builder, you get highly customizable templates for each step of the funnel. Every template is thoughtfully built and highly optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.


**Contacts Activity**

In-depth Customer Insights to get insights into every customer – total spend, offers accepted, spend at each step & more.

You can see the contacts entering your funnel and see detailed analytics in real-time.

What's more? You can choose to send the contacts over to your CRM or nurture them using FunnelKit Automations - one of the most popular marketing automation and broadcast **CRM for WordPress**.


**Performance Dashboard**

The Performance Dashboard gives you a bird's eye view of the whole funnel builder.

Here's what you can see right inside your WordPress dashboard:

- The total number of contacts, orders, and revenue
- Revenue generated per contact
- Best performing funnel and pages – See the leaderboard to know what's working and what's not
- Recent activities – A log to track the users' actions in real-time


== FUNNEL BUILDER PRO FEATURES ==

**Opt-in pop-ups/Lightbox**

When a user clicks on the CTA button placed on the Opt-in page, the form pop-ups are on their screen. It allows you to capture leads in two steps, hence helping maximize conversions.

**Conversion Optimized WooCommerce Checkout Pages**

Your checkout doesn't necessarily need to be just a single product-focused. You can add multiple products, allowing users to accept one or more out of the list.

Furthermore, use all these [WooCommerce Checkout Optimizations](https://funnelkit.com/woocommerce-checkout-page-optimization/) to minimize cart abandonment.

You can even create offers such as buy two get one free or buy three get two free, allowing users to make a choice and pick a deal they love.


**AOV-Boosting Order Bumps**

Order Bumps are the offers made to the user on the WooCommerce checkout page. One can add them to the cart with one click.

- **Rule-based order bumps** to show or skip a bump based on the cart items, cart total, coupons used, & more.
- Different order bump skin options to make the bump match brand colors
- Different display positions for the order bump
- Compatible with WooCommerce Subscriptions & Membership-based products.


**One-Click Upsells**

With post-purchase upsells, secure the immediate order before pitching other offers. Users can accept them with a single click, which boosts the store's average order value. The friction-free purchases enhance user experience after the WooCommerce checkout page.

- Rule-based upsells to present offers based on item(s) bought, payment gateway used, order total & more.
- Mobile-responsive, pre-built one-click upsell offer page templates for Elementor.
- Dynamic Offers Paths to link one offer with another and display offers based on the previous offer's acceptance.
- Multiple upsells on a single page.
- Ability to separately charge a shipping fee on the upsell product.


**In-Depth Analysis**

Get deep insights into your funnels and the revenue they generate for your store. View the number of visits, total revenue, revenue per visit, and more for each funnel separately. You can select the date range and view the user's activity during that period. What's more? You can view the conversion rate and revenue for every step in the funnel.

When you're equipped with data, you can make meaningful decisions and connect the dots.


**All Premium Templates**

With Funnel Builder Pro, you get access to our entire library of stylish-looking, conversion-optimized templates for all pages, from Opt-in to WooCommerce checkouts to the Thank you pages.

Due to our deep integration with the page builder, you can customize all the funnel pages in Elementor. But if you wish to use any other page builder of your choice, FunnelKit gives you the liberty to do that too. Use the personalized codes and design the page you want.


**A/B Testing**

With FunnelKit, you can split test any page in the funnel. Want to know a single WooCommerce checkout converts better or a multi-step checkout page? Or offering one order bump work in favor or multiple bumps? A/B testing is the answer.

Divide the traffic and send them over to different pages to study which path gives out better conversions.

- Split test products offered
- A/B test product prices – analyze which price converts better
- See which page design leads to more sales.
- Try out varying headings and sales copy to promote the one that converts best.

These would help you nail the products and sales page copy that resonates the most with your customers.
